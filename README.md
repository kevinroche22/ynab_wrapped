# YNAB Wrapped
A (very) quick and dirty Dash app supplying some year end views on my finances that the native YNAB app doesn't supply.

Future Kevin: You can run this from the terminal by navigating to your local copy of the repo via `cd` and `ls` and then running `python <local_path_to_ynab_wrapped_here>/ynab_wrapped.py`.
